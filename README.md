# June LeetCoding Challenge

This is a challenge by [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/explore/featured/card/june-leetcoding-challenge/) consisting of 30 daily problems over the month of June. A problem is added each day, and we have 24 hours to make a valid submission. I will be uploading my solutions in this repository after the deadline to make a valid submission for the given problem has passed.

## Week 1: June 1st–June 7th

* Day 1: [Invert Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/explore/featured/card/june-leetcoding-challenge/539/week-1-june-1st-june-7th/3347/)

    > Recursive Inversion | 
    > Time: O(n) |
    > Space: O(n)

* Day 2: [Delete Node in a Linked List](https://leetcode.com/explore/featured/card/june-leetcoding-challenge/539/week-1-june-1st-june-7th/3348/)

    > Exchanging Node Data | 
    > Time: O(1) |
    > Space: O(1)
